1. Daily Scrum 

We decided for the project-topic creating a chessgame.
Stefan Kuhn wanted to make the chessgame better, so he had the idea create the "Fog of War"-Chess.

The FogofWar-Chess contains the regular chessgame, but each of the pieces has a light-radius.

The whole team agreed with the idea.

Afterwards we distributed the tasks in the following way:

Task List
